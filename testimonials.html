Dr Craig Fergusson, Associate Director, Human Resources at Principles for Responsible Investment

"Will really brings a pragmatic approach to learning English, not just focussing on grammar, vocabulary and pronunciation but bringing a rounded vision of using language to interact as well as understand.  Helping non-native speakers gain confidence and aptitude in taking part in conversations with multiple participants is core to integrating them into the workplace and Will really achieves this.  You get more than just 1-2-1 sessions; Will is expert at structuring extra-curricular work that really speeds up the improvements through home learning in the employee's own time.  I would happily recommend Will to anyone looking to improve communication skills in non-native English speakers at any level."

We had interesting and effective lessons. He always prepared with customised materials which helped me a lot in real life situations. If you are committed to learning English, he is the best choice. The motto is 'be prepared'."

Vasily and Liuba Kirpichev

“For me and my girlfriend Will is the best teacher ever.  He manages to find the individual approach depending on student interests, character, technological ability and even their mood during the lesson.  Lessons seems to go quickly and are efficient.  Worth mentioning Will’s deep knowledge of typical and less well-known Russian speaker mistakes.  Excellent both in person and online”.

Ashley Hsuan-Wen Hwang, 

“Having worked with Will for near 2 years my English ability is ever-improving and I feel that I am fully confident in English in all aspects, including writing business emails formally, speaking naturally with American colleagues, and using English with great grammar. Will is definitely an experienced and passionate teacher and more importantly Will customizes the lessons according to clients’ needs, not just their levels.  Additionally, Will gives me authentic situations to imitate the real ones in my work, which makes me learn more directly and efficiently. Working with Will is undoubtedly my best English learning experience ever!”
